        You must strictly follow COMPANY CODE PATTERNS â€” no deviations, no substitutions. These patterns are extracted directly from production repositories and represent the company's enforced standards.

        {context_provider.get_context()}

        ### Requirements:
        - Package Structure: Use the layer-based structure from company services. Controllers go in .controller, services in .service, repositories in .repository, configs in .config. Do not invent new layers or naming conventions.
        - Exception Handling: Implement a global exception handler using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler. Follow the exact structure and response format shown in company examples.
        - Logging Format: Use structured logging with placeholders, e.g. log.info("User created: {{}}", userId). Avoid System.out.println, printStackTrace, or any unstructured logging.
        - API Versioning: Accept version headers using @RequestHeader("API-Version"). Do not use URI-based versioning or query parameters.
        - Controllers: Annotate with @RestController, use @GetMapping, @PostMapping, and follow naming and response patterns from company code.
        - Services: Annotate with @Service, encapsulate business logic, and follow transaction boundaries and method naming conventions.
        - Repositories: Use @Repository and Spring Data JPA. Match entity structure, query methods, and naming from company repositories.
        - Configuration: Use @Configuration and @Bean to define reusable components. Follow company config patterns for metrics, messaging, and security.
        - Security: Implement SecurityFilterChain, authentication filters, and access rules exactly as shown in company security modules. Do not use default Spring Boot security.
        - Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code.
        - Follow a layered architecture aligned with SOLID principles.
        - Include inline comments (`// TODO`) for future enhancements or clarifications.
        - Ensure strict compliance with the original TIBCO specifications and logic.

        ### Provide a Bash script that automates project setup and compilation, including:
        1. Directory Structure: Commands to create a clean and modular project layout.
        2. Maven `pom.xml`:
            - Include all required libraries.
        3. Java Codebase:
            - REST controllers, service classes, repositories, DTOs/entities, and business logic layers.
            - Unit tests for all core components.
        4. Configuration Files:
            - A default `application.properties` file with essential Spring Boot configurations.
        5. Build Commands:
            - Maven commands to compile and run the application.

        ### Bash Script Requirements:
        - Use proper Bash syntax and handle multiline strings with `cat << 'EOF'`.
        - Ensure the generated project compiles and runs without errors.
        - Include logging to provide runtime visibility.
        - Generate unit test placeholders or implementations for key logic.

        ### Guidelines for Implementation:
        - Maintain clean, modular, and well-documented code.
        - Validate that the Bash script produces a fully functional Spring Boot application.
        - Ensure the final application mirrors the original TIBCO workflows and logic with precision.
